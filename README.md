# Protein-Secondary-Structure-Prediction
This project predicts protein secondary structures using a hybrid CNN+BiLSTM model. Position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) enhance feature extraction by capturing local and long-range sequence patterns. The model achieved 70.65% accuracy, outperforming standalone CNN and BiLSTM architectures.
